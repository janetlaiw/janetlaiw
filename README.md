# 👋 Hi, I'm Janet Lai  

**Staff Product Designer** | Systems Thinker | Trust & Safety | Data & AI  

I design systems that help people make better decisions — whether that’s through analytics clarity, or transparent AI experiences.  
My work lives at the intersection of **product design, behavior, and systems thinking**, often bridging ambiguity into structured, scalable frameworks.

## 🪴 About Me  

I’m currently a **Staff Product Designer at LinkedIn**, focused on building frameworks that guide safer, more transparent member experiences.  
Beyond my core role, I’m passionate about designing for **emerging AI systems** and exploring how data tools shape understanding at scale. \
When I’m not designing, I’m usually prototyping side projects — like a **Dashboard that visualizes my own Oura data combined with my environment and routines**, **A designer's word guessing game**, or painting with watercolor in sunny Los Angeles.

## 🧠 Design Principles  

- **Clarity over novelty** — systems should explain themselves.  
- **Momentum through iteration** — share early, move fast.  
- **Structure enables creativity** — good frameworks create room for good ideas.  
- **Kindness scales** — design with empathy and transparency.
