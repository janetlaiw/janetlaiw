# 👋 Hi, I'm Janet Lai  

**Staff Product Designer** | Systems Thinker | Trust & Safety | Data & AI  

I design systems that help people make better decisions — whether that’s through trust interventions, analytics clarity, or transparent AI experiences.  
My work lives at the intersection of **product design, behavior, and systems thinking**, often bridging ambiguity into structured, scalable frameworks.

## 🪴 About Me  

I’m currently a **Staff Product Designer at LinkedIn**, focused on building frameworks that guide safer, more transparent member experiences.  
Beyond my core role, I’m passionate about designing for **emerging AI systems** and exploring how data tools shape understanding at scale. \
When I’m not designing, I’m usually prototyping side projects — like a **React dashboard that visualizes Oura data + moon phases**, or shaping clay in a ceramics studio in Los Angeles.
